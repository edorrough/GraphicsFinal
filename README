HW3: Textures and Lighting
Evan Dorrough

Based on examples 15 and 13 taken from Willem A. (Vlakkies) Schreuder
CSCI4229 Summer 2020

Demonstrates using lighting and textures to create a scene consisting of solid objects that can be viewed in three dimensions under user control. The light should move and be contollable, and the textures add realism to the scene.

There are three lighting modes, and the project starts out illuminated by a yellow street light. This light is controllable with key bindings. You can switch the light mode through to "floating" or to "off" with the L key. The floating light can be moved and dimmed to demonstrate my project's lighting and texturing.

Key bindings
  l          Switch through lighting choices (floating, streetlight, none)
  m          Toggles texture mode modulate/replace
  a/A        decrease/increase ambient light
  d/D        decrease/increase diffuse light
  s/S        decrease/increase specular light
  e/E        decrease/increase emitted light
  n/N        Decrease/increase shininess
  []         Lower/rise light
  x          Toggle axes
  arrows     Change view angle
  PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
  0          Reset view angle
  ESC        Exit

APPROX time spent on the project: 10 hours, though I could have easily spent more. Most annoying about the project was the struggle to get gluCylinder and gluSphere objects to have functioning normals, though getting them textured was a breeze!
